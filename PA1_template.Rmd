This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
 reading the CSV file, name as Df1
 install package
 
 1. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r read.cvs, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

    setwd("C:/Users/xiaot/datasciencecoursera/Reproduce analysis/repdata_data_activity")
    Df1<- read.csv("activity.csv",header = TRUE )# Equivalent explicit version
    head(Df1)

# check the missng percent
    missing_percent <- colMeans(is.na(Df1)) * 100
    missing_percent
    steps_per_day <- Df1 %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

# View the result
    steps_per_day

# Summary (min, median, mean, max)
    summary(steps_per_day$total_steps)

##Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
    ## Create histogram
   Step_per_day_p<-  hist(
  steps_per_day$total_steps, 
  main = "Total Steps Taken per Day", 
  xlab = "Total Steps", 
  ylab = "Frequency (Number of Days)",
  col = "lightblue",
  breaks = 10  # Adjust number of bins
    )
  print(Step_per_day_p)  

```
2. What is the average daily activity pattern?


Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r mean and median}
## Step 1: Calculate Average Steps per Interval
    avg_steps_per_interval <- Df1 %>%
    group_by(interval) %>%
    summarise(avg_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))  # Handle missing values
    ggplot(avg_steps_per_interval, aes(x = interval, y = avg_steps)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", linewidth = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Daily Activity Pattern",
    x = "5-Minute Interval",
    y = "Average Steps Taken"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
    
```
3. Imputing missing values
Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the data set 
```{r}
    # check the missng percent
    missing_percent <- colMeans(is.na(Df1)) * 100
    missing_percent
    
# Check if any days have all NAs (resulting in NaN means)
    daily_means <- Df1 %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarise(daily_mean = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
    print(daily_means)
    daily_means %>% filter(is.nan(daily_mean))  # Problematic dates
    
## Add a global mean since some days dairy mean are missing
    global_mean <- mean(Df1$steps, na.rm = TRUE)  # Fallback if daily mean is NaN

    Df1_imputed <- Df1 %>%
    left_join(daily_means, by = "date") %>%
    mutate(
    steps = coalesce(steps, daily_mean, global_mean)  # Replaces NA → daily mean → global mean
  ) %>%
  select(-daily_mean)  # Clean up
##Verify All NAs Are Replaced
    sum(is.na(Df1_imputed$steps))  # Should be 0
## Calculate Total Daily Steps (After Imputation) 
    daily_totals <- Df1_imputed %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))
    summary(daily_totals)
##Create Histogram    
    ggplot(daily_totals, aes(x = total_steps)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
    labs(title = "Histogram of Total Steps per Day (After Imputation)",
       x = "Total Steps per Day",
       y = "Frequency") +
    theme_minimal()
## Calculate Mean and Median    
    mean_median <- daily_totals %>%
    summarise(
    mean_steps = mean(total_steps),
    median_steps = median(total_steps)
  )

print(mean_median)
```
